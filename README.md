RNA-Expression-Analysis
=======================

- RNA expression analysis is algorithmically complex task

- Our system address this challenge by decreasing its execution time using Hadoop. It first creates a data pipeline to connect the various phases involved in expression analysis and then uses MapReduce to decrease the algorithmic complexity

- Used Hadoop, Java, genome sequencing tools, Linux
